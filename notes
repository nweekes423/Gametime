#PERPLEXITY ANSWER How and why MPM module was usedin apache config
Based on the search results and the information provided about your Apache setup, the recommended MPM (Multi-Processing Module) to use is the `event` MPM.

The key reasons are:

1. **Apache Version**: The search results indicate that the `event` MPM has improved significantly in Apache 2.4 and is the preferred choice for Apache 2.4 and later versions. Your Apache server is running version 2.4.59, which aligns with the recommendation to use the `event` MPM.

2. **Performance Considerations**: The search results suggest that the `event` MPM is designed for high-performance and low-latency, which is well-suited for your use case of HTTP to HTTPS redirection in a Django app.

3. **Compatibility**: The search results mention that the `event` MPM handles KeepAlive requests more efficiently than the `worker` MPM, as it uses a Listener thread for each child process, which avoids thread locking issues.

4. **Modular Approach**: The search results emphasize the importance of using the appropriate MPM for your specific requirements and environment. Since you're running Apache 2.4.59, the `event` MPM appears to be the best choice based on the information provided.

To summarize, based on the Apache version you're running (2.4.59) and the performance requirements of your Django app's HTTP to HTTPS redirection, the recommended MPM to use is the `event` MPM. This should provide the best balance of performance, efficiency, and compatibility for your setup.

Remember to thoroughly test your configuration in both development and production environments to ensure that the HTTP to HTTPS redirection is working as expected.
